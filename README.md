# JavaScript Web Scraper

A simple web scraper, built with JavaScript and Puppeteer, collates a list of Amazon UK's top 50 kindle books.

`node index.js` will create a `data.json` file with the following information:

```
[
  {
    "title": "",
    "image": "",
    "author": "",
    "price": "",
    "rating": ""
  },
  ...
]
```
